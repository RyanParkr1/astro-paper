My name is Ryan Parker. This is my personal blog where I publish long form thoughts on a lot of topics(Life, Crypto, Politics etcâ€¦)

This blog is mostly for me to look back on but if something I post here is useful to someone then that is even better.

### A list of other blogs I recommend checking out:

- [Nakamoto Institute - Works to contextualize bitcoin into the broader story of cryptography and freedom](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/library/)_

- [Visakanv](https://www.visakanv.com/blog/)
